INVITATION

You are invited to participate in a study that involves research. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the amount professionals in behaviour analysis in Ontario are willing to pay for potential fees related to participating in a regulated health profession. 

 

 

WHAT‚ÄôS INVOLVED

As a participant, you will be asked to anonymously provide consent and complete an online questionnaire. You will be asked about your professional credentials, income, and education and other demographic questions. Subsequently, you will be provided with a series of hypothetical questions regarding your likelihood of opting into fees related to participating in the regulated health profession of behavior analysis. In the case that you are not certified in the field, you will be asked to fill out an additional questionnaire, indicating the number of hours you would be willing to allocate to becoming part of the regulated health profession. Participation will take approximately ten minutes of your time.

 

 

POTENTIAL BENEFITS AND RISKS

Possible benefits of participation include providing information regarding the value of regulation of the field of behaviour analysis in the province of Ontario. The results may inform policy makers regarding the potential uptake of practitioners in a regulated body, and thus, provide information regarding the financial feasibility of various regulation models. There are no known or anticipated risks associated with participation in this study.

 

 

CONFIDENTIALITY
